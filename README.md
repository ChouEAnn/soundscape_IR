# soundscape_IR
Tools of soundscape information retrieval

Author: Tzu-Hao Harry Lin (schonkopf@gmail.com)

This is a python version of Soundscape_Viewer (originally MATLAB-based tool), 
which aims to facilitate the visualization, source separation, and event 
identification of long-duration field recordings.

In order to facilitate the cloud computation, several functions were added to 
assist the data retrieval from cloud-based platforms (e.g., Google Drive). 
Now you can access the audio data archived on pumilio-based soundscape archive 
(e.g., Asian Soundscape) and visualize a large amount of audio data by using 
the long-term spectrograms. You can also employ the source separation to 
imporve the acoustic analysis result. Finally, apply a clustering tool to 
investigate the acoustic phenology.

Future works:
1. More source separation and clustering functions will be added (Scheduled at 2019 fall).
2. To support the interactive visualization of clustering result (scheduled at 2019 summer).
